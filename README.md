# Responsive Tables

Tables that work on small devices, oh my!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zurb/responsive-tables.git
bin/setup
```

To see this in action just run `bin/server` and go to http://localhost:8080

## Installation

  1. Copy the `responsive-tables.js` and `responsive-tables.css` to your project. Then add them to your HTML page:
  1. In the `<head>` of your page add:

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="responsive-tables.css">
  ```

  1. Before the closing `<body>` tag add:

  ```html
  <script src="responsive-tables.js"></script>
  ```
